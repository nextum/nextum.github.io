## How to suggest a new entry (without pull request)

> Note: You need a free github account to suggest a new entry. You can create one [here](https://github.com/signup).

1. Open a new issue [here](https://github.com/nextum/nextum.github.io/issues/new).
2. On the right side choose the Label **New Entry**
3. As title enter the Latin word you want to add
4. Then in the textbox enter the markdown of the entry you want to add. (see below)

## Formatting

Nextum uses [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) to format, but you only need to now that something enclosed in two asterisks makes it ** **bold** ** and one asterisk makes it * *italic* *.

An entry with a single sense should look like this:

```
**entry** class (grammar) (etymology) *french — english — german* 
```

An entry with multiple senses like this:

```
**entry** class (grammar) (etymology)
1. *french — english — german* 
2. *french — english — german*
3. *french — english — german*
```

**entry** the new entry

**class** the abbreviations of the class the word belongs to. Should be something like m. / v. / adj. / etc. 

**grammar** optional grammar explanations enclosed in parentheses. Should be something like (gen. -oris) / (irr.) / (major, optimus) / etc.

**etymology** optional etymology explanations enclosed in parentheses. Should be something like (gr.) / (hebr.) / etc. 

> Note: See also [Abbreviations](https://nextum.github.io/abbreviations.html).

You can also contribute, if you only know one of the languages used in the dictionary (French, English, German). Just leave the translations empty in the languages that you don't know. For example if you want to add biochemia, but you only know the english translation, you would append: 
```
**biochemia** f. sg. * — biochemistry — * 
```
